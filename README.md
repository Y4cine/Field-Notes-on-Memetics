# Field Notes on Memetics

*A personal logbook of cultural pattern-watching, philosophical questioning, and memetic exploration.*

---

## 📖 What is this?

This is not a manifesto.  
Not a scientific paper.  
Not a theory.  
Not yet.

**Field Notes on Memetics** is an open notebook —  
a place to think out loud about memes, meaning, and the strange machinery of culture.

It is where essays, thought experiments, metaphors, and diagrams accumulate like sediment,  
tracing the emergence of a discipline that doesn't quite exist yet —  
but perhaps ought to.

---

## 🧠 Why memetics?

Because culture has a physics.  
Because stories evolve.  
Because ideas replicate, mutate, compete —  
and sometimes, they **win**, whether they're true or not.

And yet, memetics remains a fragile term.  
Too metaphorical for biology.  
Too systemisch for the humanities.  
Too slippery for the social sciences.  
Too tempting for ideologues.

**This project dares to take memetics seriously — without dogma.**  
Not as hype.  
Not as total theory.  
But as a *lens* — a way to look at human behavior, belief, and structure  
as if it were shaped by forces **beyond intent**.

---

## 🎯 What is the goal?

To build — slowly, doubtfully, and with care —  
a body of thought that could, someday, become the **foundation of an academically discussable framework for memetics**.

This is **not** a peer-reviewed project.  
There are no claims of authority.  
But it is guided by the belief that:

> 🧬 *Culture evolves.*  
> 🧭 *We can study it.*  
> 🛠️ *And we can build tools to shape it responsibly.*

This is not (yet) a public initiative.  
But the project was designed with openness in mind.

No roadmap.  
No team.  
No claim.  
Just one person, thinking out loud, and hoping others might, too.
