# Field Notes on Memetics

*A personal logbook for observing cultural patterns, philosophical questioning, and memetic explorations.*

## What is it?

**Field Notes on Memetics** is an open notebook —  
a place to think aloud about memes and how they shape our world.
How they create the illusion that we think for ourselves, but serve other purposes.
How we might recognize this and act accordingly.

It is a logbook and a clarification board.
Here I explore and create. Ideas, theories.
I try to understand memes themselves, in all their manifestations and relationships.
I examine religion, politics, history and everything I recognize as memetically relevant.

Here emerge:
- Drafts of scientific papers
- Manifestos for partial aspects of memetics-relevant topics (e.g. democracy, education, and more)
- a glossary of everything I could identify memetically, both comprehensive and in reference-book form
- Essays with thought experiments

## Why Memetics?

Because we think that we think, but actually memes think us.
Because we get caught up in memes and fail to understand the overarching mechanisms of ideas and memes.
Because we deserve to be able to make rational decisions beyond our own cultural circles.

Because we live in a world where globalization and technocratization make memes overpowerful – and we still want and must act.

And yet memetics remains a fragile concept:  
Too metaphorical for biology.  
Too systemic for the humanities.  
Too elusive for the social sciences.  
Too tempting for ideologues.

**This project dares to take memetics seriously – without dogma.**  
Not as hype.  
Not as a grand theory.  
But as a *lens* – a way to view human behavior, beliefs, and structures  
as if they were shaped by forces **beyond intention**.

## What is the goal?

Slowly, doubtfully, and with care –  
to build a corpus of thought that could one day form the **foundation for an academically discussible framework for memetics**.

This is **not** a peer-reviewed project.  
No claims to authority are made.

## What is included?

- "papers/" – Papers for academically formalized presentations of theory
- "unfolded/" – Sketches of what memetics is
- "glossary/" – a dictionary of memetic terms and concepts
- "case_studies/" – Attempts to conduct memetic analyses on prominent and marginal topics
- "essays/" – Application of memetic principles to everyday problems

## Language

The main working language is **English**, but I write in **German**. My texts are translated by AIs / LLMs.    

Additional versions may be added over time, including **Arabic** and **French**.  
This is not a translation project, but a *language-inclusive* one.

---

## Collaboration?

This is not (yet) a public initiative.  
But the project was designed with openness in mind.  
If you're reading this and something resonates with you — feel free to fork, write, or suggest.

No roadmap.  
No team.  
No claims.  
Just one person thinking aloud — and hoping that others might do so too.
